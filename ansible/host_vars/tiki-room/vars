# Templates are named in the following format (all lower case): <OS Distribution>-<OS Version>-<VM Size>
# Current OS offerings are:
# - Ubuntu 
#    - 24.04
# - Fedora
#    - 42

# Current VM sizes are:
# - Small: 2 cores, 2GB memory, 8 GiB virtual disk
# - Medium: 2 cores, 4GB memory, 16 GiB virtual disk
# - Large: 4 cores, 4GB memory, 32 GiB virtual disk
# - Large Plus: 4 cores, 4GB memory, 48 GiB virtual disk

# Currently, only single NIC VMs using IPv4 are supported via cloning.  The IP address also

# Future enhancement will allow specification of additional software to automatically deploy to
