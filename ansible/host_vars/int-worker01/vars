# Ansible vars template for OpenShift nodes created via Ansible (configure_openshift_cluster).

# Cluster deployed via Agent Installer and Matchbox (iPXE):

# Role of this node in the cluster. 
# - master
# - worker

node_role: "worker"

# IP address assigned to this node on the Primary Interface

ip_address: 10.1.71.164

# Ansible Playbook supports booting node via one interface, but installing on a 
# different interface. (Disabling the boot interface on install)  All these fields
# are necessary.  In the case of a single NIC node, interfaces and MAC addresses
# should be the same.
